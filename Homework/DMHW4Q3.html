            Homework 4 Question 3
        </h1>

        <p>
        Recall that in any group of 6 people there are either
        3 mutual friends or 3 mutual enemies.
        <br />
        In the group of 10 people consider any person x.
        <br />
        1. <i>x</i> is either friends with 6 people or
        enemies with 4 people.
        <br />
        (a) Amongst the 6 friends of x either there are
        3 mutual friends or 3 mutual enemies.
        Hence including x there are 4 mutual friends or 3 mutual enemies.
        <br />
        (b) Amongst the 4 enemies of x, if two people
        are mutual enemies then including x we have
        3 mutual enemies. Else the 4 enemies of x are mutual friends.
        Hence in either case there are 4 mutual friends or 3 mutual enemies.
        <br />
        2. <i>x</i> is either enemies with 6 people or
        friends with 4 people. Note that we have just
        exchanged the role of friends and enemies
        and so as above we can argue that there are
        4 mutual enemies or 3 mutual friends.
        Hence we conclude that in any group of 10 people
        there are either (4 mutual friends or 3 mutual enemies)
        and (3 mutual friends or 4 mutual enemies).
