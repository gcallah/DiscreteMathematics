                Applications of Recurrence Relations

                <p>
                    In this section we will show that recurrence relations can be
                    used to study and to solve counting problems. For example, 
                    suppose that the number of bacteria in a colony doubles every hour.
                    If a colony begins with five bacteria,
                    how many will be present in n hours? 
                    <br>
                    To solve this problem, let <i>a</i><sub>n</sub> be the number of 
                    bacteria at the end of <i>n</i> hours. Because the number of bacteria 
                    doubles every hour, the relationship a<sub>n</sub> = 2a<sub>n-1</sub> 
                    holds whenever <i>n</i> is a positive integer.
                    This recurrence relation, 
                    together with the initial condition
                    a<sub>0</sub> = 5, uniquely determines
                    a<sub>n</sub> for all nonnegative integers <i>n</i>.

                        The monks in a temple have the job of moving all of the
                        disks on one peg to another, constrained by these rules:
                        <br>
                        1) Only one disk can be moved at a time.
                        <br>
                        2) Each move consists of taking the upper disk from
                        one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack
                        i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the
                        uppermost disk on a stack.
                        <br>
                        3) No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

                        Recurrence:

                        <br>
                        Why is this the recurrence? Well, to move disk <em>n</em>,
                        we first move disks 1 to <em>n</em> - 1 to the spare peg,
                        then move <em>n</em> to the target peg, then move disks 1
                        to <em>n</em> - 1 to the target peg.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        So we guess the closed-form solution is something like
                        2<sup>n</sup>. Why? Well, we multiply by a factor of 2 each
                        recursion!
                        <br>
                        Now, let's try writing out a few elements of the sequence:
                        <br>
                        T(0) = 0
                        <br>
                        T(1) = 2*0 + 1 = 1
                        <br>
                        T(2) = 2*1 + 1 = 3
                        <br>
                        T(3) = 2*3 + 1 = 7
                        <br>
                        T(4) = 2*7 + 1 = 15
                        <br>
                        T(5) = 2*15 + 1 = 31
                        <br>
                        So is the answer 2<sup>n</sup> - 1?
                        <br>
                        Base case: T(0) = 0 = 2<sup>0</sup> - 1.
                        <br>
                        Yes!
                        <br>
                        Now induction: we want to show that, <em>if</em> T(n - 1) =
                        2<sup>(n - 1)</sup> - 1, <em>then</em> T(n) will equal
                        2<sup>n</sup> - 1.
                        <br>
                        How proof by induction works: we have proved our base case.
                        Now we try to prove that for any n, if for n - 1 (or
                        sometimes all smaller n) our
                        hypothesis is true, then it is true for n as well. And since we
                        have already proved that for n = 0 it is true, that will
                        mean it will be true for all n whatsoever.
                        <br>
                        So we substitute in for n - 1:
                        <br>
                        T(n) = 2(2<sup>(n - 1)</sup> - 1) + 1
                        <br>
                        = 2 * 2<sup>(n - 1)</sup> - 2 + 1
                        <br>
                        = 2<sup>n</sup> - 1
                        <br>
                        And we are done!

                    Suppose that a recursive algorithm divides a problem of size <i>n</i> into a subproblems,
                    where each subproblem is of size <i>n/b </i>(for simplicity, assume that <i>n</i> is a multiple 
                    of <i>b</i>; in reality, the smaller problems are often of size equal to the nearest
                    integers either less than or equal to, or greater than or equal to, <i>n/b </i>).
                    Also, suppose that a total of <i>g(n)</i> extra operations are required in the 
                    conquer step of the algorithm to combine the solutions of the subproblems
                    into a solution of the original problem. Then, if <i>f(n)</i> represents the number

                The <i>inclusion–exclusion</i> principle is a counting technique which generalizes the familiar method of obtaining the number of elements in the union of two finite sets; symbolically expressed as
                <br>
                <img src = "https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/05f67b2ce4414f2a1f96e4210a86d71028aa53b6">

                where A and B are two finite sets and |S| indicates the cardinality of
                a set S (which may be considered as the number of elements of the set,
                if the set is finite). The formula expresses the fact that the sum of
                the sizes of the two sets may be too large since some elements may be
                counted twice. The double-counted elements are those in the intersection
                of the two sets and the count is corrected by subtracting the size of the intersection.

                Many counting problems can be solved using the principle of inclusion–exclusion.
                For instance, we can use this principle to find the number of primes
                less than a positive integer. Many problems can be solved by counting
                the number of onto functions from one finite set to another.
                The inclusion–exclusion principle can be used to find the number
                of such functions. The famous hatcheck problem can be solved using
                the principle of inclusion–exclusion. This problem asks for the
                probability that no person is given the correct hat back by a
                hatcheck person who gives the hats back randomly.
