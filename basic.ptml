                            A <b>set</b> is an unordered collection of objects,
                            called elements or members of the set.
                            A set is said to contain its elements.
                            We write a &isin; A to denote that a is an element of
                            the set A. The notation a &notin;
                            A denotes that a
                            is not an element of the set A.

                            We write <i>a</i> &isin; <i>A</i> to denote that
                            <i>a</i> is an element of
                            the set <i>A</i>. The notation <i>a</i> &notin;

                            is not an element of the set <i>A</i>.

                            There are two ways of describing,
                            or specifying the members of, a set
                            <br>
                            The two ways are:
                        </p>
                            <p>
                            <b>Roster method:</b>
                            refers to a technique in representing a set
                             by directly listing all of its elements,
                             which are separated by commas and enclosed
                             by a pair of curly brackets.
                            <br>
                            Example: The set V of all vowels
                            in the English alphabet can be
                            written as V = {a, e, i, o, u}.
                            <b>Example</b>: The set <i>V</i> of all vowels
                            in the English alphabet can be
                            written as <i>V</i> = {a, e, i, o, u}.

                            <p>
                            <b>Set builder:</b>
                            We characterize all
                            those elements in the set by stating the
                            property or properties they must have to be members.
                            <br>
                            For instance, the set O of all odd
                            positive integers less than 10 can be written as
                            O = {x | x is an odd positive integer less than 10}
                            or, specifying the universe as the set of positive
                            property or properties they
                            must have to be members.
                            <br>
                            For instance, the set <i>O</i> of all odd
                            positive integers less than 10 can be written as
                            <i>O</i> = {x | x is an odd
                            positive integer less than 10}
                            or, specifying the universe as the set of positive
                            integers, as
                            <i>O</i>={<i>x</i> &isin; <b>&#8484;+</b> |
                            <i>x</i> is odd and <i>x</i> &lt; 10}.

                        <p>
                        We often use this type of notation to describe sets
                        when it is impossible to list all the elements
                        of the set. For instance, the set <b>Q+</b> of all
                        of the set. For instance, the set <b>&#8474;+</b> of all
                        positive rational numbers can be written as
                        <br>
                        <b>&#8474;+</b>={x &isin; <b>&#8477;</b>
                        | <i>x</i> = <i>p</i> / <i>q</i>,
                        for some positive integers <i>p</i> and <i>q</i>}.
                        <br>
                        These sets, each denoted using a boldface letter,
                        play an important role in discrete mathematics:

                            is called the absolute complement or
                            simply complement of A, and is denoted by an A
                            with a bar over it.
                            <br>
                            For instance:
                            <br>
                            1. {1, 2} &minus; {1, 2} = &empty;.

                        <p>
                        There are various ways to represent sets using a computer.
                        One method is to store the elements of the set in an
                        unordered fashion. However:
                        <br />
                        Wastes time searching when doing union, intersection,
                        etc.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        We can represent set by a bit string: bit <em>x</em>
                        is on if <em>x</em> is in the set.
                        <br />
                        <b>For Example </b>:
                        Let U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10},
                        and the ordering of elements of U has
                        the elements in increasing
                        order; that is, a<sub>i</sub> = i.
                        What bit strings represent the subset of
                        all odd integers in U, the subset
                        of all even integers in U,
                        and the subset of integers not exceeding 5 in U?
                        <br>
                        Solution:
                        The bit string that represents the set of odd
                        integers in U, namely, {1, 3, 5, 7, 9},
                        is 10 1010 1010.

                        All even integers in U: 01 0101 0101.

                A <b>function</b> is a relation between a set of inputs

                Let A and B be nonempty sets. A function f from
                A to B is an assignment of exactly one element of
                B to each element of A. We write f(a) = b if b is
                the unique element of B assigned by the function f
                to the element a of A. If f is a function from A to B,

                    A function f is said to
                    be one-to-one, or an injunction,
                    if and only if f(a) = f(b)
                    implies that a = b for all a and b in the domain of f.
                    A function is said to be injective if it is one-to-one.
                    <br>
                    Note that a function f is one-to-one if and
                    only if f (a) &ne; f (b) whenever a &ne; b. This
                    way of expressing that f is one-to-one is obtained by
                    taking the contrapositive of the
                    implication in the definition.
                    <br>
                    <b>For example:</b>
                    Determine whether the function f
                    from {a, b, c, d} to {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

                    <br>
                    <b>Answer:</b> The function f is one-to-one because f takes
                    on different values at the four elements of its domain.
                    as
                    f(a) = 4, f(b) = 5, f(c) = 1, and f(d) = 3

                    A function f from A to B is
                    called onto, or a surjection, if and only if for every

                    A function f is called surjective if it is onto.

                    <br>
                    This function is onto, because for every

                <b>For Example</b>: Show that the set of all integers is countable.

                <b>Solution</b>: We can list all integers in a
                sequence by starting with 0 and alternating between
                positive and negative integers: 0, 1, -1, 2, -2, ...
