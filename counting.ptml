                              one of the 100 possible integers. <br>
                              The product rule shows that there are

                Finding <i>P</i><sub>6</sub>
                directly is difficult. To find <i>P</i><sub>6</sub>

                this the number of strings with no digits.
                By the product rule, the number of strings of
                six characters is 36<sup>6</sup>,
                and the number of strings with no
                digits is 26<sup>6</sup>. Hence,

                    <p>
                    To find the number of these applicants who majored
                    neither in computer science nor in business, we
                    can subtract the number of students who majored
                    either in computer science or in business (or both)
                    from the total number of applicants.
                    Let <i>A</i><sub>1</sub> be the set of students who majored in
                    computer science and <i>A</i><sub>2</sub> the set of students
                    who majored in business.
                    Then <i>A</i><sub>1</sub> &cup;
                    <i>A</i><sub>2</sub> is the
                    set of students who majored in
                    computer science or business (or both),
                    and <i>A</i><sub>1</sub> &cap;
                    <i>A</i><sub>2</sub> is the set of students who
                    majored both in computer science and in business.
                    By the subtraction rule the number of students
                    who majored either in computer science
                    or in business (or both) equals:
                    <br>

                    |<i>A</i><sub>1</sub> &cup; <i>A</i><sub>2</sub>|
                    = |<i>A</i><sub>1</sub> | + |<i>A</i><sub>2</sub>|
                    - |<i>A</i><sub>1</sub> &cap; <i>A</i><sub>2</sub>|
                    = 220 + 147 - 51 = 316.
                    <br>
                    We conclude that 350 - 316 = 34 of the applicants
                    majored neither in computer science nor in business.

                  and the same right neighbor?<br>

                    <p>
                    We arbitrarily select a seat at
                    the table and label it seat 1.
                    We number the rest of the seats in numerical order,
                     proceeding clockwise around the table.
                      Note that are four ways to select the person for seat 1,
                      three ways to select the person for seat 2,
                      two ways to select the person for seat 3,
                       and one way to select the person for seat 4.
                        <br>Thus, there are <b>4! = 24 </b>ways
                        to order the given four people for these seats.
                        However, each of the four choices for
                         seat 1 leads to the same arrangement,
                         as we distinguish two arrangements only
                         when one of the people has a different immediate
                          left or immediate right neighbor.
                          Because there are four ways to
                          choose the person for seat 1,
                          by the division rule there are <b>24/4 = 6

The pigeonhole principle states that there must

there are more objects than boxes.
However, even more can be said when the number of
objects exceeds a multiple of the number of boxes.
 For instance, among any set of 21 decimal digits
 there must be 3 that are the same.
 This follows because when 21 objects are distributed into 10 boxes,
  one box must have more than 2 objects.<br>

Because the integers a<sub>j</sub> , j = 1, 2, . . . , 30 are all

there must be indices i and j with a<sub>i</sub> = a<sub>j</sub> + 14.

Because the letters ABC must occur as a block,
we can find the answer by finding the number of permutations
of six objects, namely, the block ABC and the
individual letters D, E, F , G, and H . <br>
Because these six objects can occur in any order,
there are <b>6! = 720</b> permutations of the
s letters ABCDEFGH in which ABC occurs as a block.<br><br>

and not the individual cookies or the order
in which they are chosen, matters.<br>

                    The number of ways to choose six cookies is
                    the number of 6-combinations of a set with four elements. <br>
From Theorem 2 this equals C(4 + 6 - 1, 6) = C(9, 6).<br>
C(9, 6) = C(9, 3) = (9 * 8 * 7) / (1 * 2* 3) = 84 <br>
There are<b> 84 </b>different ways to choose the six cookies.

                    <p>
Because some of the letters of SUCCESS are the same,
the answer is not given by the number of permutations of seven letters.
This word contains three Ss, two Cs, one U , and one E.<br>
To determine the number of different strings
that can be made by reordering the letters, first note that
the three Ss can be placed among
the seven positions in C(7, 3) different ways,
leaving four positions free. <br>
Then the two Cs can be placed in C(4, 2) ways,
leaving two free positions. The U can be placed in C(2, 1) ways,
leaving just one position free. Hence E can be placed in C(1, 1) way.
<br> Consequently, from the product rule,
the number of different strings that can be made is<br>

                Counting the number of ways of placing n
                indistinguishable objects into k distinguishable
                boxes turns out to be the same as counting the
                number of n-combinations for a set with k elements
                when repetitions are allowed.
                <br>
                The reason behind this is that there is a
                one-to-one correspondence between n-combinations
                from a set with k elements when repetition
                is allowed and the ways to place n indistinguishable
                balls into k distinguishable boxes.
                To set up this correspondence, we put
                a ball in the i<sup>th</sup> bin each time
                the i<sup>th</sup> element of the set is
                included in the n-combination.

                How many ways are there to place 10
                indistinguishable balls into eight distinguishable bins?

                <p>
Counting the ways to place n
distinguishable objects into
k indistinguishable boxes is more difficult
than counting the ways to place objects,
distinguishable or indistinguishable objects, into distinguishable boxes.
                </p>
                <p>
                <b>Example:</b><br>

three indistinguishable offices, when each office can

                <p>
Some counting problems can be solved by determining the number of ways
 to distribute indistinguishable objects into indistinguishable boxes.
 We illustrate this principle with an example.<br>

                    Begin with 123.
The next permutation is obtained by interchanging 3 and 2 to obtain 132.
Next, because 3 &gt; 2 and 1 &lt; 3, permute the three integers in 132.
Put the smaller of 3 and 2 in the first position, and
then put 1 and 3 in increasing order in positions 2 and 3 to obtain 213.
This is followed by 231, obtained by interchanging 1 and 3, because 1 &lt; 3.
The next larger permutation has 3 in the first position,
followed by 1 and 2 in increasing order, namely, 312.<br>
Finally, interchange 1 and 2 to obtain the last permutation, 321.
We have generated the permutations of 1, 2, 3 in lexicographic order.<br>
