                        An experiment is a procedure that 
                        yields one of a given set of 
                        possible outcomes. The sample space of 
                        the experiment is the set of possible 
                        outcomes. An event is a subset 
                        of the sample space.

                        <i>E</i> = "bitten by shark" (imagine it's .001)

                        <br />
                        Therefore, <i>p</i>(<i>E</i> | <i>F</i>) = .5
                        <br />
                        Or, "Half the time, if there is a shark around, it
                        bites someone."

                        Notice how this was <i>not</i> the case with the shark

                        <i>p</i>(<i>E</i>)<i>p</i>(<i>F</i>) (which was .000001).
                        This would not be

                        <b>Pairwise independence versus mutual independence:</b>
                        <br />
                        The best way to understand this difference is to
                        consider a situation like this, with two coin tosses:
                        <br />
                        Event <i>A</i> is both tosses are the same.
                        <br />
                        Event <i>B</i> is the first toss is heads.
                        <br />
                        Event <i>C</i> is the second toss is heads.
                        <br />
                        Notice that if <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> both occur, or 
                        both don't occur, <i>A</i> occured for sure.
                        And if only one of <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> occured, 
                        <i>A</i> didn't occur for sure.
                        <br />
                        Nevertheless, any two pairs of these events, taken on
                        their own, <i>are</i> independent.

                    <p>
                        How many people have to enter a party before it is
                        likely (p &gt; .5) that two of them have the same 
                        birthday?
                        <br />
                        Note that this <i>resembles</i> a pigeonhole problem,
                        but with an important difference: we are not asking how
                        many do we need to be <i>certain</i> two have the same
                        birthday (answer: 367), but how many do we need for it
                        to be <i>likely</i>?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We are going to solve this by solving the complement
                        of the problem: we will solve for <i>p<sub>n</sub></i>,
                        the probability that they all have different birthdays,
                        and then the probability two will have the same
                        birthday will be 1 &minus; <i>p<sub>n</sub></i>.
                        The first person obviously will not have "the same"
                        birthday as anyone else. The probability the 
                        second person will have a different birthday is 
                        365 / 366. For the third (assuming no match yet!)
                        it is 364 / 366. And so on.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So our question becomes, at what point does 
                        1 &minus; <i>p<sub>n</sub></i> become greater 
                        than .5? And the answer is the surprisingly small
                        number 23!
                        <br />
                        All of this would be just a curiosity, except it
                        is the same question as "How likely is it our
                        hashing function will produce a collision after
                        hashing <i>n</i> items?"
                        <br />
                        In hashing, we are mapping <i>n</i> keys to
                        <i>m</i> slots, where <i>n</i> is usually
                        much greater than <i>m</i>. (For instance, possible
                        student names to 100 slots in a class roster.)
                        We want to know if students are randomly mapped
                        to a slot with probability 1/<i>m</i>, how likely
                        is it that two students will map to the same slot?
                        (Too many collisions slow down our hashing algorithm.)

                        These are examples of <i>probabilistic 
                        algorithms</i>. Most of the time, we study 
                        algorithms that produce a definite answer.
                        But probabilistic algorithms produce correct
                        answers only with some likelihood.
                        A <i>Monte Carlo Algorithm</i> runs repeated 
                        trials of some process until the answer it gives is
                        "close enough" to certainty for the purposes of
                        the person or persons employing the algorithm.

                        <b>Example</b>: For an integer that is not prime, it
                        will pass Miller's test for fewer than <i>n</i>/4 bases
                        <i>b</i> with 1 &lt; <i>b</i> &lt; <i>n</i>. We can
                        generate a large number and try, say, <i>k</i>
                        iterations of the algorithm, and if it passes each 
                        iteration, the that it is not prime are
                        (1/4)<sup><i>k</i></sup>. For 30 iterations, this will
                        give us a probability that <i>n</i> is composite
                        of less than 1/10<sup>18</sup>.
