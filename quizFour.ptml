<br> 
5) Given the table below
<br>
<br>

<br>
Use set identity and logic:
<br>
<br>
5.1)    Show that if A and B are sets then A − B = A ∩ B.
<br>
5.2)    Prove the associative law that if A, B, and C are sets, then A ∪ (B ∪ C) = (A ∪ B) ∪ C.
<br>
5.3)    Prove the associative law that if A, B, and C are sets, then A ∩ (B ∩ C) = (A ∩ B) ∩ C. 
<br>
<br>

Example:  to prove A ∩ B = B ∩ A, 
<br>
    X ∈ A ∩ B     &emsp;      ⟷   {x | x ∈ A ∧ x ∈ B}   &emsp;  by definition
<br>
{x | x ∈ A ∧ x ∈ B} ⟷  &emsp; {x | x ∈ B ∧ x ∈ A}   &emsp; by commutative law
<br>
{x | x ∈ B ∧ x ∈ A} ⟷  &emsp; X ∈ B ∩ A    &emsp;   by definition

<br>
<br>

Solution of 5)
<br>
5.1)  &emsp;  Both sides equal {x | x ∈ A ∧ x ∉ B}. 
<br>
    A − B = {x | x ∈ A ∧ x ∉ B}  &emsp; by definition
<br>
    A ∩ B = {x | x ∈ A ∧ x ∉ B} &emsp; by definition
<br>
    So  A − B = A ∩ B
<br>
<br>
5.2)   &emsp;  Both sides equal {x | x∈A ∨ x∈B ∨ x∈C }
<br>
    A ∪ (B ∪ C) = {x | x∈A } ∪ {x | x∈B ∨ x∈C }   &emsp;  by definition
<br>
&emsp;= {x | x∈A ∨ x∈B ∨ x∈C }     &emsp;   by definition
<br>
    (A ∪ B) ∪ C     = {x | x∈A ∨ x∈B } ∪ {x | x∈C }   &emsp;  by definition
<br>
&emsp;= {x | x∈A ∨ x∈B ∨ x∈C }   &emsp;     by definition
<br>
 So  A ∪ (B ∪ C) = (A ∪ B) ∪ C
 <br>
 <br>
5.3)  &emsp;  Both sides equal {x | x∈A ∧ x∈B ∧ x∈C }
<br>
    A ∩ (B ∩ C) = {x | x∈A } ∩ {x | x∈B ∧ x∈C }   &emsp;  by definition
<br>
               &emsp; = {x | x∈A ∧ x∈B ∧ x∈C }     &emsp;   by definition
<br>
    (A ∩ B) ∩ C     = {x | x∈A ∧ x∈B } ∩ {x | x∈C }  &emsp;   by definition
<br>
               &emsp; = {x | x∈A ∧ x∈B ∧ x∈C }      &emsp;  by definition
<br>
    So  A ∩ (B ∩ C) = (A ∩ B) ∩ C
<br>
<br>


6) Given the table of set identities:
<br>
<br>
<img src="quiz5(2).png" width="700" height="600">
<br>
<br>

Prove the following new identities. Label each step in your proof with the set identity used to establish that step.
<br>
<br>
a)  A ∩ (A ∪ B) = A ∩ B
<br>
b)  (A ∩ C) ∪ (A ∩ C) = C
<br>
c)  A ∪ (A ∩ B) = A ∪ B
<br>
d)  A = (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ B)
<br>
<br>


For a), b), and c) see text section 3.5 exercise 3.5.2 solutions.  Solution of d) is similar to exercise 3.5.2 b.
