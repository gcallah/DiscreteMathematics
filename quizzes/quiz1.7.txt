A direct proof of a conditional statement p → q assumes:#q is true so then p must be true#^p is true so then q must be true#p and q both are false#p and q both are true
A theorem is a:#false statement#statement that is always true#proof#^statement that can be proven to be true
Indirect proofs make use of the followig:#p → q ⇔ ~p ∨ q#p ∨ T ⇔ T#p ∧ p ⇔ p#^p → q ⇔ ~q → ~p
Which of the following is NOT true for mistakes in proofs?#Most common erros are mistakes in arithmetic and basic algebra#Conclusion needs to follow logiccally#Each step should be correct i.#^Most common errors are mistakes in grammar
What is wrong with this proof? Theorem: If n2 is positive, then n is positive. Proof: Suppose that n2 is positive. Because the conditional statement "If n is positive, then n2 is positive is true, we can conclude that n is positive.#Because n is a complex number#^We cannot conclude that because we are not using a valid rule of inference#If n2 is positive then n must be negative#The proof is wrong due to grammatical errors
