A direct proof of a conditional statement p → q assumes:#q is true so then p must be true#^p is true so then q must be true#p and q both are false#p and q both are true
A theorem is a:#false statement#statement that is always true#proof#^statement that can be proven to be true
Indirect proofs make use of the following:#p → q ⇔ ~p ∨ q#p ∨ T ⇔ T#p ∧ p ⇔ p#^p → q ⇔ ~q → ~p
Which of the following is NOT true for mistakes in proofs?#Most common errors are mistakes in arithmetic and basic algebra#Conclusion needs to follow logically#Each step should be correct#^Most common errors are mistakes in grammar
What is wrong with this proof? <b>Theorem:</b> If n<sup>2</sup> is positive, then n is positive. <b>Proof:</b> Suppose that n<sup>2</sup> is positive. Because the conditional statement "If n is positive, then n<sup>2</sup> is positive" is true, we can conclude that n is positive.#Because n is a complex number#^We cannot conclude that because we are not using a valid rule of inference#If n<sup>2</sup> is positive then n must be negative#The proof is wrong due to grammatical errors
