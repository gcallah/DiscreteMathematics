                 In Mathematics, A relation between elements of two sets can
                 occur in many contexts. Like consider a relation between two
                 sets of stations linked through trains.

                 A relation set between two relations say <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>
                 is a subset of cartesian products of <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>

                     Ordered Pairs can be used to express relation between two elements.
                     These are called as binary relations.

                        relation. The leftmost two triangles are congruent,
